# PizzaMania-dapp

## Demo Web Application
<image src="./demo.gif"/>

This is a web based application where people get rewards for ordering pizza from some of the Pizza places.
The front end is made using HTML, CSS and JS.
There is no database related with this app cause of its decentralization nature.
The backend is written in Ethereum blockchain with contract written in Solididy.

# How to run the program?

Since deploying this app on real ethereum blockchain will cost actual money, the app rather runs in a test
network called "Ganache".

# Things required for the dapp to function

1) Ganache Local Hosting Blockchain (Provides you with 10 Free Ethereum Accounts with 100 Ether to spend on each)
2) MetaMask Extension on Browser (To Change regular browser to a blockchain browser)
3) web3.js (v.0.2)
4) Code Editior to Work with (I choose Visual Studio Code)
